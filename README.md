# Decor

## Introduction

Decor is a CLI tool built with the goal of providing a seamless experience for developers to set up their development environment quickly and efficiently.

It is built in Go and uses the [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) library to create a user-friendly command-line interface. The tool is designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of new features and support for more programming languages, tools and more in the future.
